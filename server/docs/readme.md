## DataBase

In xeonex we use a database to store the data of the users and the transactions. We use a MySQL database and we use the following tables:

- Users: This table stores the data of the users that use the bot.
- Transactions: This table stores the data of the transactions that the bot makes.
- Transactions History: This table stores the data of the transactions that the bot has made in the past.

# How do i connect to the database?

To connect to the database you need to create a new database in MySQL and call it bugsbyte, then you just need to check application.properties and change the username and password to your MySQL username and password.

## Notes
- Some controllers or services, or even domain classes, dont have the best logic or the best code in terms of escability, but thats a consequence of a hackaton, we had 48 hours and many times we have to use "fast code" to make the project work, but we are always looking to improve the code and make it better. We also have some code that is not used, but we are always looking to improve the code and make it better.
- Some documentation is not complete once more by the time we had to make the project work, but we are always looking to improve the code and make it better.
- Some documentation is generated by AI, so it may not be perfect.
